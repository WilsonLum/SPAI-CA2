 SP AI CA2 Project

## PART A: UNSUPERVISED LEARNING 
### Background
a)	Given the iris dataset, if we knew that there were k types of iris, but did not have access to a taxonomist to label them: we could try a clustering task: split the observations into well-separated group called clusters.

### Dataset
Use the iris dataset from scikit-learn

## PART B: DEEP LEARNING 
### Background
Implement an image classifier using a deep learning network. You may use any of the well-known Deep Learning (DL) network models such as AlexNet, ResNet, etc.

### Dataset
Use the MNIST dataset.
